        <p align="left corner"><b style="font-size:150%; color:rgb(135, 13, 13);">Kiwis</b> are flightless birds native to New Zealand. They are unique for their long beaks and small wings, and they are nocturnal, primarily active at night. Kiwis are known for their brown, hair-like feathers and their sensitive nostrils at the end of their beaks.</p>
        <p align="left corner">These birds are omnivores, feeding on insects, worms, and fruits. Kiwis are also notable for being the only birds with nostrils located at the tip of their beaks, which helps them forage for food in the ground.</p>
